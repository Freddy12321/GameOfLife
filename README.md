# GameOfLife
Game of life created with several GUIs
Assumptions:
I allowed what I felt was a resonable amount of options in the starting GUI
I was unsure of whether the project would need to allow for specific starting boards to be input, so I included two methods of inputting them, through a file and through a GUI, as well as a method to randomly generate boards.
I allowed the board to expand if there is a live cell on the edge, this can be disabled throught the starting GUI however.
I built a GUI in order to display the Board while it is in play, the GUI displays newly live cells in blue, cells previously alive and still alive in black, and recently dead cells in red.
Known issues: 
When the grid is large (100x100+)the game slows down.
The game ocasionally gets stuck for and unown reason.
The grid does not get drawn well on larger boards
